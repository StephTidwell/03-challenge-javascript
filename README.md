JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator
## Description
This challenge required me to develop an application that an employee could use to generate a random password depending on the parameters they choose. This program will run in the browser and will include dynamically updated HTML and CSS, which will be powered by JavaScript code that I built. It should have a clean and polished user experience that is responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
